      <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
      <p>I’m a third-year Computer Science student aiming to turn ideas into impactful digital solutions. Browse through my portfolio to learn more about my education, skills, and professional experience.</p>
      <h3>Aspirations</h3>
      <p>My short-term goal is to secure an internship at Google or a similar leading tech company where I can work on real-time projects with talented professionals. I want to be part of a team that builds products and platforms that make a meaningful difference in people’s lives.

In the long term, I aspire to become a full-stack web developer or digital marketing strategist who understands both the technology behind a platform and the psychology behind its users. I aim to use my skills to bridge the gap between functionality and user experience.

Ultimately, I want to build products that are not only innovative but also accessible, inclusive, and impactful. I see myself contributing to open-source communities, mentoring future students, and continuing to learn every step of the way.</p>
